        <p>Western Electric Company Rules (WECO) have been widely used for
            Shewhart control charts in order to increase the sensitivity of detecting
            assignable causes of process change. This application implements eight commonly
            used WECO rules and allow to apply the combination of these individual rules
            for detecting the deviation from a stable process.</p>
